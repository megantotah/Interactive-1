				Many say that<br>

				They help us in discovery<br>
				And bring our imagination to life.<br>

				And we let them flow down the stream<br>
				To Forgottenland.<br>

				But there are some special dreams,<br>
				The ones that become a reality.<br>
				These are rare, an abnormality,<br>

				To run away from what we do not know,<br>
				And simply let things go.<br>
