				Many say that<br>
				Dreams are lovely.<br>
				They help us in discovery<br>
				And bring our imagination to life.<br>
				They allow us to convey<br>
				The dreams we are afraid to dream,<br>
				And we let them flow down the stream<br>
				To Forgottenland.<br>

				The ones that become a reality.<br>
				These are rare, an abnormality,<br>
				Because society has taught us to pick<br>
				Up the pencil and never write the book;<br>
				To run away from what we do not know,<br>
				And simply let things go.<br>
				And we let them.<br>
