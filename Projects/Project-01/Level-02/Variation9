				Many say that<br>
				<strong>Dreams</strong> are lovely.<br>
				They help us in <strong>discovery</strong><br>
				And bring our <strong>imagination</strong> to life.<br>
				They allow us to convey<br>
				The dreams we are afraid to dream,<br>
				And we let them flow down the stream<br>
				To <strong>Forgottenland.</strong><br>
			<br>
				But there are some special <strong>dreams,</strong><br>
				The ones that become a <strong>reality.</strong><br>
				These are rare, <strong>an abnormality,</strong><br>
				Because society has taught us to pick<br>
				Up the pencil and never write the book;<br>
				To <strong>run away</strong> from what we do not know,<br>
				And simply let things go.<br>
				And <strong>we let them.</strong><br>
