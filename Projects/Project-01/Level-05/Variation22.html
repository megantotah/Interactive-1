        Many say that
        Dreams are lovely.
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="50">
        They help us in discovery
        And bring our imagination to life.
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="60">
        They allow us to convey
        The dreams we are afraid to dream,
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="70">
        And we let them flow down the stream
        To Forgottenland.
      
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="40">
        But there are some special dreams,
        The ones that become a reality.
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="40">
        These are rare, an abnormality,
        Because society has taught us to pick
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="40">
        Up the pencil and never write the book;
        To run away from what we do not know,
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="40">
        And simply let things go.
        And we let them.</p>
